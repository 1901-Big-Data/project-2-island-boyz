Our project explores datasets from records of the Olympic games over a hundred year timespan, and a dataset of countries and their population statistics. Our aim is to find a correlation between any one demographical statistic, for example population size, population density, GDP, education, or lifespan, and the chance of a country winning at a specific Olympic athletic event. We, early on in this project, conjecture that a large population size may have a correlation with a country winning athletic events of global renown. Athletic events of lesser renown seem to rely purely on other statistical data.
