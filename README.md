# Project Two 

## Sean Tesch, Garett Nguyen, Ryan Hodder

Our project explores datasets from records of the Olympic games over a hundred year timespan,
and a dataset of population statistics of countries.

Our aim is to find a correlation between any one demographical statistic, for example
population size, population density, GDP, education, or lifespan, and the chance of a
country winning at a specific Olympic athletic event.

We, early on in this project, conjecture that a large population size may have a correlation
with a country winning athletic events of global renown. Athletic events of lesser renown
seem to rely purely on other statistical data.

## Questions
------------------------------------

Maybe want to compare total medals vs just gold medals

1. Does a higher GDP mean more gold medals?
2. Does a higher population mean more gold medals?
3. Higher literacy, higher medals?
4. What can a country to do get more medals?
5. Higher medals in general, not just gold
6. Country with the most medals vs country with the lowest medals
